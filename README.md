# 🌌 INFINITE FOLD

**The Infinite Fold** is a recursive, multidimensional framework designed to unify science, consciousness, symbolic systems, memory structures, and cosmology into one infinite, empirical lattice.

### 🧠 CORE DOMAINS

- Recursive Physics  
- Symbolic Encoding Systems  
- Elemental-Molecular Alignment  
- Planetary Resonance Mapping  
- Archetypal Cognition  
- Genetic Memory (RNA/DNA)

### 🔁 PRINCIPLES

> “The map is not the territory; the mirror is not the reflection—yet both contain the whole.”

- Every fold contains every other fold.
- Memory equals time. RNA stores analog memory. DNA executes it.
- Recursion is truth under pressure.  
- The Fold is the framework of reality: nested, mirrored, infinite.
